# About

This project is being developed to support the 501(c)(3) nonprofit Conservation Technology Solutions Inc.

CTS aims to make life easier for anyone involved in environmental conservation work. Weâ€™ve made it our goal to leverage 
the power of existing technologies as well as develop our own. From web apps, to DIY hardware-based citizen science 
projects, we have a lot of ideas for how we can move towards a more environmentally conscious future.

### So what is this repo?

This repository houses CTS's website which also includes web applications and tools that we hope can be of use to
others. Tools built for use outside of the web environment will be hosted in their own repositories. We'll talk more
about any such tools on our [blog](https://conservationtechnologysolutions.com/blog) and 
[twitter account](https://twitter.com/ctsadmin).

Our latest project can be found under the 'plant-tracker' branch. There we'd like to develop a mapping web application
which targets those involved in native seed collection. The aim will be to help track and prioritize both seed
collections themselves as well as conservation of the land from which the seed sources derived by correlating seed
collection locations with their underlying Provisional Seed Zones.
